# Telco Customer Churn
Hi everyone, Telco Customer Churn is my 3rd project in completing Data Science Bootcamp at Purwadhika Digital School. I will explain how to develop and implement a machine learning model to a business.

## Context
Telco Systems is a prominent global player in the telecommunications industry, boasting over four decades of expertise in crafting cutting-edge high-performance network communication solutions. Their state-of-the-art software and hardware offerings revolutionize network excellence, empowering service providers to deliver the utmost innovation and service quality to their clientele.

In this context, customer retention, retaining existing customers, stands as a paramount pillar of business success. Telecom companies (Telcos) confront a significant challenge: customer churn. This phenomenon occurs when customers discontinue Telco services and migrate to other providers. Customer churn poses a detrimental impact on a company's revenue, given that the cost of acquiring new customers typically exceeds that of retaining existing ones.

The dataset at hand comprises a variety of features and attributes essential for predicting whether a customer will churn or remain loyal. Potential features include subscriber tenure, dependency status, monthly expenditures, among others.

## Problem Statement
Telco confronts a critical challenge in the realm of customer churn management. The growing customer mobility and fierce industry rivalry exacerbate the churn conundrum. Consequently, Telco necessitates an efficient solution to not only pinpoint customers at risk of churning but also to execute suitable measures to curtail customer attrition. It's a well-established fact that the company's outlays surge when prospecting new customers compared to the relatively lower expenses involved in preserving the existing customer base.

## Goals

**1. Develop a Churn Prediction Model**

**2. Improve Customer Retention**

**3. Enhance Company Expenditure Efficiency**

**Stakeholders**: The executive management and marketing teams at Telco Systems.

## Analytic Approach

The analytics approach includes a series of steps, including data exploration analysis, data processing, model building, and model evaluation. Telco customer data will be used in this process to train a classification model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn. Once the model has been built, the next step is to perform performance evaluation using test data to ensure its accuracy.

## Metric Evaluation
The main evaluation metric in this project is the **F2-score**, which places emphasis on reducing errors in predicting customer churn, particularly false negatives. The main focus was to create a model that is effective in identifying customers at risk of churn and provide an efficient solution for Telcos in managing customer churn. The F2-score was chosen to ensure that the model can reduce as many cases as possible where customers who will actually churn (important cases) are misclassified as not churning.
